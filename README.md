# DocumentRetrievalModel
A formal introduction to GraphLabCreate and TuriCreate.
GraphLab Create , established in 2009 is an end-to-end data analysis and data developement software. At the crux of GLCreate, is a data structure called SFrame. Similar to a Dataframe from Pandas library, an SFrame also exhibits data in table form. However, an SFrame is a highle scalable data structure that sits in the disk memory of a computer and increases with increase in requirement. GraphLab Create using this data structure has reduced the gap between data enthusiasts and machine learing or deep learning tasks.
GLCreate, using the basic .show() function runs an in-browser website that resides in your localhost and has an array of pre-ready plots, models and vizualisations ready.This makes a data practitioner understand the concept easier.
TuriCreate is also an open-source library in Python that finds its use in Core Machine Learning Models like image classification, object detection, recommender systems and much more.

In this repository I have harnessed the power of TuriCreae to make a Document Object Retrieval model. The main idea behind this model is that on a particular users entry, the algorithm will return all the similar documents.
For example: If a user inputs the option of Elton John, the model will return all the documents related to Elton John.
